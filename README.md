# Connect 4
A Connect 4 game made with Haskell

Can be made connect N of any board size by changing:

boardWidth = 7

boardHeight = 6

toWinLength = 4

This is my very first code in Haskell made for educational purposes.
Fell free to submit improvements and to use this code in any way.

Have a very Functional day!
