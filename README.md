# Connect 4
A Connect 4 game made with Haskell

Can be made connect N of any board size by changing in the Connect4.hs file the constants bellow:

```
boardWidth = 7
boardHeight = 6
connectLength = 4
```

There is a text UI implementation and a main function in the file Connect4TextUi.hs .

This is my very first code in Haskell made for educational purposes.
Fell free to submit improvements and to use this code in any way.

Have a very Functional day!
